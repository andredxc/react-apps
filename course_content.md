# Working with React and Go

### Lesson 16: Components and props

Created `AppHeader.js` file, which renders a text message sent from `index.js` through a parameter named title in the html object for App Header.

### Lesson 17: More about props

Learned how to pass the same argument as in the previous lesson in a better and more organized way: using props and the spread operator `{...myProps}`.

### Lesson 18: React events

How to wire a button to a function: `onClick=`
Created a function which uses `fetch()` to download a placeholder json and add this json to an ul (unordered list) html element.
Arrow functions (`=>`) are used inside the `.then()` function to pass arguments arround easily.
